    intro:
      'Business sites get squeezed from two sides: marketing wants rankings and rich content; users want fast, calm pages. Next.js gives you the tools to satisfy both if you decide structure early - routing, metadata, images, and what actually ships to the client.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Every route should answer one primary question. The homepage explains who you are and where to go next; a service page proves fit for one offer; contact lowers friction to a conversation. When intent is muddled, you get duplicate headings, repeated keywords, and layouts that fight the reader.',
          'Once intent is fixed, your `<title>`, `description`, H1, and first screen of content naturally reinforce each other. Search engines pick up a coherent topic; humans scan faster.',

        paragraphs: [
          'In the App Router I keep metadata close to the route. Static pages use `export const metadata`; dynamic segments use `generateMetadata` so each URL gets unique titles and descriptions derived from real data - not a single global template.',
          'Avoid repeating the same description across many URLs. It signals low-quality templates and wastes the snippet users see in results.',

          'LCP is not abstract: it is usually a hero image, a large font block, or a client-only paint. I default to `next/image` with explicit `sizes`, priority only above the fold, and formats the browser can decode cheaply.',
          'CLS comes from ads, lazy fonts, or reserving space for images and embeds. A fixed aspect ratio or min-height for media slots removes most “jumps” users blame on “slow sites” even when TTFB is fine.',

          'Use a single H1, logical H2/H3 order, and internal links that help navigation - not keyword stuffing. If a sentence only exists for a keyword, delete it.',
          'Structured data (JSON-LD) is a supplement, not a replacement for readable text. I add `WebSite`, `Person`, or `Article` where it reflects what is already visible on the page.',

          'Marketing pages rarely need heavy client trees. Server Components and static segments keep interactive islands small: a form, a carousel, analytics. That directly improves hydration cost and Time to Interactive on mid-tier phones.',
          'When you do need client state, colocate it. A giant client layout wrapping the whole marketing site is a common reason “Next feels slow.”',

    keyTakeaways: [
      'Define one primary job per route before writing metadata or headings.',
      'Use `generateMetadata` for dynamic URLs so snippets stay unique and honest.',

    intro:
      'Role-based UIs look like “hide a menu item” until you debug a ticket where an operator could see a status the API never allowed, or an admin action skipped audit. The fix is almost always explicit rules in one place - not scattered `if (role === ...)` checks.',

      {
        id: 'make-permissions-explicit',
        title: 'Make permissions explicit in API and UI',
        paragraphs: [
          'The UI should reflect what the API enforces, not the other way around. I keep a small matrix (role × action × resource) or capability strings the server checks on every mutating route.',
          'Duplicating role logic in React and Express guarantees drift. Either share a module (monorepo), code-generate constants, or treat the server as the source of truth and derive UI flags from a `/me` payload.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Operational tools fail when people cannot answer: what state is this in, what can I do next, and who else is affected? Extra badges rarely fix that; a tight state model does.',
          'I document allowed transitions (e.g. open → in_progress → resolved) and reject invalid jumps at the API. The UI simply offers valid actions.',

      {
        id: 'inventory-and-tickets-consistency',
        title: 'Keep inventory and ticket updates consistent',
        paragraphs: [
          'When a ticket implies a stock movement, either wrap both updates in a transaction (where the datastore allows) or design compensating events you can replay. Half-updated rows are worse than a slow page.',
          'For MongoDB, embedding vs referencing depends on update frequency. High-churn lines often belong in their own collection with references, so you do not rewrite huge documents on every status change.',

        id: 'maintainability-as-delivery-speed',
        title: 'Maintainability is delivery speed six months later',
        paragraphs: [
          'Feature teams measure “done” at merge. Operators measure “done” when Tuesday’s edge case still works. Folder-by-feature routes, typed DTOs, and repeatable list/detail patterns pay off when the client asks for one more role.',
          'I avoid “smart” generic components that encode business rules in props. Those become prop-drilling nightmares. Prefer boring pages composed of dumb UI + thin hooks.',
        ],
      },
    ],
    keyTakeaways: [
      'Enforce permissions on the server; mirror results in the client.',
      'Model workflows as explicit states and transitions, not ad-hoc flags.',
      'Treat cross-entity updates (inventory + ticket) as consistency problems.',
      'Structure code by feature so role additions do not scatter changes.',
    ],
    conclusion:
      'Role-based MERN apps punish implicit rules. If you name capabilities, model states, and keep mutations honest at the API, the React layer stays understandable — and you ship the next workflow change without fear. Building SaaS roles next? Read the RBAC guide, then Contact.',

    intro:

        id: 'routing-and-url-state',
        title: 'Routing and URL state for shareable views',
        paragraphs: [
          'Filters belong in the URL when users need to share a view: `?status=open&assignee=me`. It also makes back/forward predictable.',

        title: 'Performance includes comprehension speed',
