    intro:
      'Leaking an API key is usually not “someone read the repo” - it is `NEXT_PUBLIC_` on a secret, or a server key referenced from a Client Component. Next bundles `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into the browser. Everything else is only safe on the server if you never pass it across the RSC wire to the client.',

    intro:
      'Single-stage `FROM node` images with the full repo and devDependencies are easy - and fat. Multi-stage builds copy only what you need to run: built JS, production node_modules, and a slim runtime. That reduces attack surface and cold-start pull time.',
