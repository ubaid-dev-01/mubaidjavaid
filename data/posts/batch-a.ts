    intro:
      'REST is unfashionable in some circles, but most product teams still consume JSON over HTTP. The goal is not purity - it is contracts that a mid-level developer can call without reading your codebase. That means consistent paths, honest status codes, and error bodies that say what went wrong.',

        id: 'nouns-and-verbs',
        title: 'Nouns in URLs, verbs in HTTP methods',
        paragraphs: [
          'I use plural resource names: `/orders`, `/orders/:id`. Actions that are not CRUD become sub-resources when it keeps idempotency clear: `POST /orders/:id/cancel` with a reason body, instead of overloading `PATCH` with magic fields.',
          'Query parameters filter, sort, and paginate: `?status=open&limit=25&cursor=abc`. I document defaults (limit cap, sort order) in OpenAPI or a short internal doc - whichever the team will actually maintain.',

          '2xx for success, 4xx for client mistakes or auth, 5xx for things you need to fix. Mixing 200 with `{ error: true }` trains clients to ignore HTTP semantics.',
